#### Extended data for Heimburg et al. (2024b). Distributed burst activity in the thalamocortical system anchors stimulus-outcome associations through multiple phases of learning.

**Data**: The dataset is accessible for download in two formats: a version with all necessary data for MATLAB scripts and a Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format for broader compatibility and ease of use across platforms. For MATLAB usage, download the files and specify the directory path in the userDataPath.mat file located in the .."\Scripts" folder. The path to the data should be assigned as a MATLAB variable ("cohortPath") for script functionality.

**Materials**: A comprehensive description of the paradigm, including setup details and technical drawings of the recording devices, is available in Heimburg, Saluti, Timm et al. (2024, preprint available at https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.08.24.609326). Additional resources, including technical documentation, can be accessed via the corresponding GitHub repository (https://github.com/GrohLab/A-tactile-discrimination-task-to-study-neuronal-dynamics-in-freely-moving-mice) or through Zenodo (DOI: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13369685).

**Scripts**: Contains all required scripts for analyzing the data.
